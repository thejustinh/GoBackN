   The states that I used were similar to the states given by Professor Smith's
implentation for a Stop and Wait file transfer. I also used his code as a basis
to start the program but changed it up to work for my sliding window Go-Back-N
implementation. 

   For testing my program, the largest file size I used was a 500,000byte file.
